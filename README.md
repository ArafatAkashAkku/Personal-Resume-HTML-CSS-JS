A personal resume, also commonly referred to as a curriculum vitae (CV) in some regions, is a document that provides an overview of your education, work experience, skills, and qualifications. Its primary purpose is to help you secure employment or opportunities in various fields. Remember that resume is often the first impression employers have of, so it's essential to make it stand out and effectively communicate qualifications for the position for seeking.
